# Chromium-build-with-widevine-and-tor
My personal chromium binary build with added security and portability. Has also widevine 
installed which gives the ability to view encrypted media that wouldn't be able to be viewed without the proprietary  chrome.
This repo also includes the opensource tor version mingw build with a simple batch script to run chromium portable with tor proxy

### webapps.bat
This script is for creating different stand alone desktop apps from chromium.  Just start the script and  enter the site name that you want to go to on the box that pops up <br>

You will see a web application launching similar to  the netflix script which launches the netflix webapp.
### chromium-tor.batust enter
This is a simple script to launch chromium browser with tor proxy.
